# AYADN

[Ayadn](https://github.com/ericdke/na) is an [App.net](http://app.net) command-line client.

The purpose of Ayadn is to let you use all the features of App.net from the console without any headaches... and then more: power, freedom and fun!

Ayadn is configurable: colors, stream content, durations, aliases, etc. 

There's also two exclusive antispam and filtering features: a blacklist of users/mentions/hashtags, and Jason Irwin's NiceRank to kick out spammers and bots from Global, with a customisable threshold.

Last but not least: Ayadn supports multiple ADN accounts! 

Authorize as many accounts as you wish, and simply switch between them in a second.
